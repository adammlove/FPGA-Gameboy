# FPGA-Gameboy

I initially got the idea to start this project at the end of my junior year of HS. I began working on this project during my senior year of high school using a Terasic DE-10 Nano FPGA and the Quartus II lite software. The original plan was to have something working by the end of my senior year, but since COVID-19 screwed everything up I'm not going to work as hard to meet that deadline and give myself unnecessary additional stress. For now this project is something I will work on in my spare time whenever I decide to sit down and work on it. Maybe I can have something working by the end of the summer unless I decide to get really productive at some point.
